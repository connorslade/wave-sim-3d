# `wave-sim-3d`

Numerically solves and visualizes the *wave equation* in three dimensions.

See [@connorslade/wave-sim](https://github.com/connorslade/wave-sim) for the 2d version of this.

## TODO

- [x] Interpolate mesh normals
- [x] Allow ticking simulation at runtime
- [ ] Offload simulation to compute shader
- [ ] Triangulation on GPU??
